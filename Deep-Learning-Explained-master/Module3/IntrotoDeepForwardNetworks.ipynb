    "### 1.1 Why is deep learning important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning methods are a form of **artificial intelligence (AI)** or **machine intelligence**. More specifically, deep learning algorithms are a type of **machine learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What properties does machine intelligence require? There have been many answers to this question over the history of computing. In this case, we will take a practical view, sometimes known as **weak AI**. There are three key properties an intelligent machine must have; a **representation** for the AI model, **inference** for the output of the model, and **learning** to train the model. The figure below shows a highly abstracted view of machine intelligence, showing the relationship between representation, learning and inference. \n",

    "\n",
    "To create useful neutral network we need a **representation** that has two important properties.   \n",
    "\n",
    "First, there needs to be a way to represent complex functions of the input. Without this property, nothing is gained, since there are numerous machine learning algorithms that work with simple representations. We will spend the rest of this section exploring this problem.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the representation needs to be **learnable**. Quite obviously, no machine intelligence representation is useful if there is not a practical algorithm to learn it. We will take up this problem in another section. "

    "To get started, let's have a look at a simple **preceptron** model. The perceptron was proposed by Rosenblatt (1962). He built on the earlier attempts at a neural network models by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and Heeb (1949). The perceptron adds **nonliner activation** to the afine network. \n",

    "The output $y$ of the perceptron is given by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(x) = \\sigma \\Big( \\sum_i w_i \\cdot x_i + b \\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the network is now nonlinear, give the **activation function** $\\sigma(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, the preceptron is nothing more than a logistic regression classifier. The fact that the preceptron could only solve linearly separable problems was pointed out by Minsky and Papert (1969). The failure of the preceptron to learn an **exclusive or (XOR)** function is well known. See for example, Section 6.1 in GBC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this representation is certainly learnable. However, as before, it does not gain us anything over well known logistic regression models."

    "### 2.3 Forward networks - A better representation!\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the  perceptron is one of representation. There is no way that this simple network can represent anything but a linearly separable function. To represent more complex functions, we need a more complex network. In more technical terms we need a network with greater **model capacity**. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we need is a network with layers of **hidden nodes** with nonlinear activation. The figure below shows a simple example of a neural network with one **hidden layer** with two nodes. Since every node (including inputs) is connected to every other node we call this architecture a **fully connected neural network**.\n",

    "### 2.4 Neural network architectures - Finding representations\n",
    "\n",
    "The representations achievable by neural network with just a single hidden layer  are quite powerful. In fact, Cybenko (1989) showed that such a network with an infinite number of hidden units using sigmoidal activation can approximate any arbitrary function. Hornik (1991) generalized this to apply to any activation function. We call this theorem the **universal approximation theorem**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A universal approximation theorem may seem like a really exciting development; especially if you are a machine intelligence nerd. However, one must be circumspect when viewing such a result. A representation with an infinite number of nodes cannot be learned in any practical sense. Still it is comforting to know that, at least in principle, a representation can be learned for arbitrarily complex problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "While infinitely wide networks with a single layer are unrealistic, we are not limited to one layer. In fact, depth is typically more effective at creating complex representations rather than width in neural networks. Depth is measured by the count of hidden layers stacked one on top of the other in the network. Hence, the term deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Figure 2.4 below shows the results of an empirical study by Goodfellow, Shlens and Szegedy (2014) of accuracy of the network vs depth. Notice that accuracy increases rapidly with depth until about 8 layers, after which the effect is reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Accuracy-Layers.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width:600px; height:350px\"/>\n",
    "<center>**Figure 2.4 Empirical results of accuracy vs. number of layers**  \n",
    "Diagram from Goodfellow et. al. 2014</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another view of the empirical study by Goodfellow et. al. is shown in Figure 2.5 below. In this case accuracy verses number of model parameters is compared for three different network architectures. The deeper network (11 layers) makes more  efficient use of the parameters in terms of improved accuracy. The number of parameters in a layer is approximately the total number of parameters divided by the number of layers. Notice that for the particular case tested convolutional neural networks are more efficient than fully-connected networks. We will discuss convolutional neural networks in a subsequent lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of particular interest is the fact that the fully-connected network and the shallow convolutional neural network appear to be over-fitting as the test accuracy actually decreases as the number of parameters increases. We will discuss the significant problems of over-fitting in neural networks in a subsequent lesson. \n",

    "### 2.6 Activation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a nonlinear activation function, a neural net is just an afine transformation. Afine transformations limit representation to only linearly separable functions. To create more general representations **nonlinear activation functions** are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "In present practice, four types of activation functions are generally used for fully connected networks. \n",

    "1. **Linear** activation is used for the output layer of regression neural networks. \n",
    "2. The **rectilinear** activation function is used for most hidden units. The rectilinear activation function is often referred to as **ReLU**.\n",
    "3. A **leaky rectilinear** activation acts like a ReLU function for positive inputs, but has a small negative value or leakage for negative input values. The leaky ReLU activation function can improve training for some deep neural networks, as the derivative is not zero below 0. \n",
    "3. The **logistic** or **sigmoid** activation function is used for binary classifiers.\n",
    "4. The **softmax** activation function is used for multi-class classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rectilinear functions are typically used as the activation function for hidden units in neural networks. The rectilinear function is defined at:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = max(0, x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rectilinear function is linear for positive responses and zero for responses less than 0.0. Notice that the derivatives of the rectilinear function are not continuous. While this might seem to be a problem, in practice, even gradient-based optimization functions work well with this activation function. \n",

    "\n",
    "The backpropagation algorithm was developed independently multiple times. The earliest work on this algorithm was by Kelly (1960) in the context of control theory and Bryson (1961) in the context of dynamic programming. Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams (1986) demonstrated empirically that backpropagation can be used to train neural networks. Their paper marks the start of the modern history of neural networks, and set off the first wave of enthusiasm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The backpropagation algorithm requires several components. First, we need a **loss function** to measure how well our representation matches the function we are trying to learn. Second, we need a way to propagate changes in the representation through the complex network For this we will use the **chain rule of calculus** to compute **gradients** of the representation. In the general case, this process requires using automatic differentiation methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of backpropagration is to learn the optimal weight for the neural network. The algorithm proceeds iteratively through a series of small steps. Once we have the gradient of the loss function we can update the tensor of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_{t+1} = W_t + \\alpha \\nabla_{W} J(W_t) $$  \n",

    "\n",
    "This rather abstract formula gives us a way to compute the expected information content of a set of values $X$. The more likely (higher probability) of $X$ the less informative it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a loss function from the definition of Shannon entropy we start with the **Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence)** or **relative entropy**. The KL divergence is an information theoretic measure of the difference between two distributions, $P(X)$ and $Q(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{D}_{KL}(P \\parallel Q) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b \\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Since $P(X)$ is fixed and we wish to find $Q(X)$ when we train our model, we can minimize the term on the right, which is the **cross entropy** defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{H}(P,Q) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\ ln_b q(x_i)$$\n",
